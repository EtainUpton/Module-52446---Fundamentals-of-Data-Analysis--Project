# 21.11.2018 I reviewed the instructions for this project:
## Problem statement 
The box plot is common in data analysis for investigating individual numerical variables. In this project, you will investigate and explain box plots and their uses. The boxplot function from the Python package matplotlib.pyplot can be used to create box plots. Your submission should be in the form of a repository containing a Jupyter notebook in which you detail your ﬁndings. In your notebook, you should: 
- Summarise the history of the box plot and situations in which it used. 
- Demonstrate the use of the box plot using data of your choosing. 
- Explain any relevant terminology such as the terms quartile and percentile. 
- Compare the box plot to alternatives.

## Etain’s plan 27/11/2018;

The box plot is common in data analysis for investigating individual numerical variables. *I need to research what a box plot is. Review videos on Moodle, and use online resources (Google it).* 
In this project, you will investigate and explain box plots and their uses. *Find some examples of what box plots can be used for in real life, and a definition for box plots.* 
The boxplot function from the Python package matplotlib.pyplot can be used to create box plots. *I need to become familiar with this boxplot function in matplotlib.pyplot, and create a box plot.* 

Your submission should be in the form of a repository containing a Jupyter notebook in which you detail your ﬁndings. In your notebook, you should: 

- Summarise the history of the box plot and situations in which it used.  – *I need to research this.*

- Demonstrate the use of the box plot using data of your choosing. – *Figure out how to use box plots and use one in conjunction with the data I am preparing for the project for module 52465.*

- Explain any relevant terminology such as the terms quartile and percentile. – *Research what ‘quartile’ and ‘percentile’ mean and find definitions.*

- Compare the box plot to alternatives. - *Locate at lease 2 alternatives to box plot, and weigh up the pros and cons of box plot versus these other options.*
